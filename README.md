## fully Bayesian analysis

The aim of this project is to develop an in-depth fully Bayesian analysis (using MCMC simulation) of real data .

Several statistical models have been introduced for the analysis of this data.nd a list of steps were  considered in developing and illustrating these statistical models and the real data analysis:

1.	illustration of the dataset
2.	explain the overall features of the statistical model such as the role of the parameters and the inferential goals of the analysis
3.	illustrate the main inferential findings (Bayesian point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing)
4.	discuss one possible alternative statistical model and illustrate results of model comparison through DIC and/or marginal 
5.	illustration of the features of the MCMC convergence diagnostics and error control.
